# 0x11. C - printf

This is a TEAM Project done during **Full Stack Software Engineering studies** at **ALX School**. It aims to learn about What are macros and how to use them, What are the most common predefined macros & How to include guard in your header files in **C language**.

## Technologies
* C files are compiled using `gcc 4.8.4`
* C files are written according to the C90 standard
* Tested on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
* Team Member: Lawrence Maduabuchi & Abdullahi Ngui.
